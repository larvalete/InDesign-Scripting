# InDesign Scripting Solutions for Error 11268

This repository contains a collection of scripts developed to address the `kIllegalScaleValueError` (error code 11268) encountered when scaling objects in Adobe InDesign using scripting.

## Overview

Error 11268 in InDesign scripting typically occurs when attempting to scale an object with an illegal or incorrect scale value. This repository documents my journey from the initial attempts that led to this error, through the developmental iterations, to the successful versions that finally resolved the issue.

## Repository Structure

- `successful-versions/`: This folder contains the scripts that successfully resolved the error. They are robust, include error handling, and are ready for use in production environments.
  
- `developmental-versions/`: Inside, you will find:
  - `initial_attempts/`: Scripts from the early stages of development. They are part of the process but may not handle all cases successfully.
  - `failed_versions/`: Scripts that did not result in successful scaling. These are included for educational purposes to demonstrate common pitfalls and debugging steps.

## Usage

To use the successful scripts, select a rectangle frame in InDesign, then run the script from the `successful-versions` folder that best fits your scaling needs.

## Future Directions

While the current focus of this repository is on providing solutions for error 11268 in Adobe InDesign scripting, we are open to expanding the repository to include solutions for other common errors encountered by InDesign scripters. Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
