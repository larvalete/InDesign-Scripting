# Cropping Frame Scripts for Adobe InDesign

This directory contains a collection of ExtendScript files for Adobe InDesign that enhance frame cropping capabilities, enabling precise size and position adjustments from various anchor points.

## Overview

The scripts provided facilitate the efficient modification of frame dimensions based on specified anchor points. This allows for tailored layout adjustments within InDesign documents, streamlining the design process.

## Scripts Included

### General Crop Script
- `general-cropping-frame.jsx`: The core script that provides the functionality to crop frame dimensions dynamically, supporting various anchor points such as center, left-center, bottom-center, and top-center.

## Developmental Versions
The `developmental-ver` folder contains scripts that are in the experimental phase or did not meet the criteria for successful implementation. These scripts are not recommended for production use but are kept for archival purposes and potential further development.

## Successful Versions
Conversely, the `successful-ver` folder houses scripts that have been tested and verified as successful. These are the recommended versions for use in production environments.

## Usage Instructions
To use a script, select a frame in your Adobe InDesign document, and run the desired script from the Scripts Panel. Follow any prompts to input parameters such as target dimensions and anchor points.

### Installation
Download the desired script files and place them in your Adobe InDesign Scripts Panel directory:
- **Windows**: `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe InDesign [Version]\Scripts\Scripts Panel`
- **macOS**: `/Applications/Adobe InDesign [Version]/Scripts/Scripts Panel`

Scripts will be accessible from the Scripts Panel within Adobe InDesign once installed.
